{"id": 765, "data": "Why is it important for blood transfusions to not occur between individuals with different blood types?\n\nThe carbohydrates on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane vary from species to species, among individuals of the same species, and even from one cell type to another in a single individual. The diversity of the molecules and their location on the cell's surface enable membrane carbohydrates to function as markers that distinguish one cell from another. For example, the four human blood types designated A, B, AB, and O reflect variation in the carbohydrate part of glycoproteins on the surface of red blood cells.\n\nKeep in mind that the body's rejection of transplanted tissues or organs or of an incompatible blood transfusion is the expected reaction of a healthy immune system exposed to foreign antigens. (It remains a largely unanswered question why a pregnant woman does not reject her fetus as nonself tissue. )\n\nTo avoid a blood transfusion being recognized as foreign by the recipient's immune system, the ABO blood groups of the donor and recipient must be taken into account. As discussed in Chapter 14, red blood cells are designated as type A if they have the type A carbohydrate on their surface. Similarly, the type B carbohydrate is found on type B red blood cells; both A and B carbohydrates are found on type AB red blood cells; and neither carbohydrate is found on type O red blood cells (see Figure 14.11). To understand how ABO blood groups affect transfusions, let's consider the immune response of someone with type A blood. It turns out that certain bacteria normally present in the body have epitopes very similar to the A and B carbohydrates. By responding to the bacterial epitope similar to the B carbohydrate, a person with type A blood makes antibodies that will react with the type B carbohydrate. No antibodies are made against the bacterial epitope similar to the type A carbohydrate \nbecause lymphocytes reactive with the body's own molecules are inactivated or eliminated during development. If the person with type A blood receives a transfusion of type B blood, that person's anti-B antibodies cause an immediate and devastating transfusion reaction. The transfused red blood cells undergo lysis, which can lead to chills, fever, shock, and kidney malfunction. By the same token, anti-A antibodies in the donated type B blood will act against the recipient's type A red blood cells. Although such interactions prevent type O individuals from receiving transfusions of any other blood type, the recent discovery of enzymes that can cleave the A and B carbohydrates from red blood cells may eliminate this problem.\n\nFigure 14.11 Multiple alleles for the ABO blood groups. The four blood groups result from different combinations of three alleles. Only two alleles exist for the pea characters that Mendel studied, but most genes exist in more than two allelic forms. The ABO blood groups in humans, for instance, are determined by three alleles of a single gene: IA, IB, and i. A person's blood group (phenotype) may be one of four types: A, B, AB, or O. These letters refer to two carbohydrates: A and B: that may be found on the surface of red blood cells. A person's blood cells may have carbohydrate A (type A blood), carbohydrate B (type B), both (type AB), or neither (type O), as shown schematically in Figure 14.11. Matching compatible blood groups is critical for safe blood transfusions (see Chapter 43).\n\n", "label": [[105, 302, "Attribute/Property/State"], [482, 629, "Attribute/Property/State"], [937, 1102, "Requirement/Constraint"], [2205, 2249, "Process/Mechanism"], [2251, 2313, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2724, 2797, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2919, 3013, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [3030, 3105, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3211, 3334, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3376, 3448, "Requirement/Constraint"], [469, 480, "Instances/Examples"], [1443, 1563, "Instances/Examples"], [2799, 2917, "Attribute/Property/State"], [3121, 3209, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2446, 2542, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [650, 824, "Definition"], [1686, 1844, "Process/Mechanism"], [1846, 2042, "Process/Mechanism"], [2315, 2435, "Process/Mechanism"], [2568, 2639, "Attribute/Property/State"], [304, 467, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1131, 1226, "Definition"], [1238, 1297, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1299, 1362, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1368, 1423, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1583, 1684, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [2044, 2203, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"]]}

The gene pool is modified if mutations alter alleles or if entire genes are deleted or duplicated. Random mating. If individuals mate preferentially within a subset of the population, such as their close relatives (inbreeding), random mixing of gametes does not occur, and genotype frequencies change.\n\nEVOLUTION A small population is vulnerable to inbreeding and genetic drift, which draw the population down an extinction vortex toward smaller and smaller population size until no individuals survive (Figure 56.12). A key factor driving the extinction vortex is the loss of the genetic variation that enables evolutionary responses to environmental change, such as the appearance of new strains of pathogens. Both inbreeding and genetic drift can cause a loss of genetic variation (see Chapter 23), and their effects become more harmful as a population shrinks. Inbreeding often reduces fitness because offspring are more likely to be homozygous for harmful recessive traits.\n\n", "label": [[51, 136, "Definition"], [141, 224, "Attribute/Property/State"], [669, 733, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1016, 1066, "Instances/Examples"], [1068, 1139, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1158, 1219, "Process/Mechanism"], [356, 453, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [226, 340, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [470, 656, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [735, 858, "Process/Mechanism"], [874, 1014, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1221, 1253, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1262, 1333, "Statistical Relevance/Correlation"]]}
{"id": 769, "data": "Why can steroids easily pass through cell membranes?\n\nSteroid hormones, such as cortisol and ecdysteroid, are lipids that contain four fused carbon rings. All are derived from the steroid cholesterol (see Figure 5.14). Epinephrine and thyroxine are amine hormones, each synthesized from a single amino acid, either tyrosine or tryptophan. As Figure 45.5 indicates, hormones vary in their solubility in aqueous and lipid-rich environments. Polypeptides and most amine hormones are water-soluble. Being insoluble in lipids, these hormones cannot pass through the plasma membranes of cells. Instead, they bind to cell-surface receptors that relay information to the nucleus through intracellular pathways. In contrast, steroid hormones, as well as other largely nonpolar (hydrophobic) hormones, such as thyroxine, are lipid-soluble and can pass through cell membranes readily. Receptors for lipid-soluble hormones typically reside in the cytoplasm or nucleus.\n\nSteroids are lipids characterized by a carbon skeleton consisting of four fused rings. Different steroids, such as cholesterol and the vertebrate sex hormones, are distinguished by the particular chemical groups attached to this ensemble of rings (Figure 5.14). Cholesterol is a crucial molecule in animals. It is a common component of animal cell membranes and is also the precursor from which other steroids are synthesized.\n\nIntracellular receptor proteins are found in either the cytoplasm or nucleus of target cells. To reach such a receptor, a chemical messenger passes through the target cell's plasma membrane. A number of important signaling molecules can do this because they are either hydrophobic enough or small enough to cross the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Such hydrophobic chemical messengers include the steroid hormones and thyroid hormones of animals.\n\nBinding of water-soluble hormones to cell-surface receptors triggers intracellular signal transduction, leading to specific responses in the cytoplasm or changes in gene expression. In contrast, steroid and thyroid hormones are lipid-soluble and readily enter target cells. There they bind to specific protein receptors in the cytosol or nucleus. These complexes of a lipid-soluble hormone and its receptor act in the nucleus to regulate transcription of specific genes.\n\n", "label": [[54, 153, "Definition"], [155, 199, "Attribute/Property/State"], [219, 337, "Definition"], [958, 1043, "Definition"], [1266, 1384, "Definition"], [1386, 1478, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1741, 1838, "Instances/Examples"], [1945, 2021, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2115, 2186, "Process/Mechanism"], [1220, 1264, "Definition"], [365, 437, "Attribute/Property/State"], [438, 493, "Attribute/Property/State"], [495, 586, "Attribute/Property/State"], [597, 701, "Process/Mechanism"], [716, 872, "Attribute/Property/State"], [874, 955, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1044, 1204, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [1577, 1630, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1841, 1943, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2188, 2310, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1480, 1575, "Process/Mechanism"], [1630, 1739, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2036, 2113, "Attribute/Property/State"]]}

The phosphate bonds of ATP are not unusually strong bonds, as \"high-energy\" may imply; rather, the reactants (ATP and water) themselves have high energy relative to the energy of the products (ADP and &#9413;i). The release of energy during the hydrolysis of ATP comes from the chemical change to a state of lower free energy, not from the phosphate bonds themselves. ATP is useful to the cell because the energy it releases on losing a phosphate group is somewhat greater than the energy most other molecules could deliver. But why does this hydrolysis release so much energy? If we reexamine the ATP molecule in Figure 8.8a, we can see that all three phosphate groups are negatively charged.

The reaction is then said to be at chemical equilibrium, and there is no further net change in the relative concentration of products and reactants.\n\nThe two opposite-headed arrows indicate that the reaction is reversible. One of the factors affecting the rate of a reaction is the concentration of reactants. The greater the concentration of reactant molecules, the more frequently they collide with one another and have an opportunity to react and form products. The same holds true for products. As products accumulate, collisions resulting in the reverse reaction become more frequent. Eventually, the forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, and the relative concentrations of products and reactants stop changing. The point at which the reactions offset one another exactly is called chemical equilibrium.

{"id": 773, "data": "Why is chromatin important in meiosis?\n\nTogether, the entire complex of DNA and proteins that is the building material of chromosomes is referred to as chromatin. As you will soon see, the chromatin of a chromosome varies in its degree of condensation during the process of cell division. Every eukaryotic species has a characteristic number of chromosomes in each cell nucleus. For example, the nuclei of human somatic cells (all body cells except the reproductive cells) each contain 46 chromosomes, made up of two sets of 23, one set inherited from each parent. Reproductive cells, or gametes: sperm and eggs: have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells, or one set of 23 chromosomes in humans. The number of chromosomes in somatic cells varies widely among species: 18 in cabbage plants, 48 in chimpanzees, 56 in elephants, 90 in hedgehogs, and 148 in one species of alga. We'll now consider how these chromosomes behave during cell division.\n\nWhen a cell is not dividing, and even as it replicates its DNA in preparation for cell division, each chromosome is in the form of a long, thin chromatin fiber. After DNA replication, however, the chromosomes condense as a part of cell division: Each chromatin fiber becomes densely coiled and folded, making the chromosomes much shorter and so thick that we can see them with a light microscope.\n\nEach eukaryotic chromosome consists of one DNA molecule associated with many proteins that maintain chromosome structure and help control the activity of genes. Together, the complex of DNA and associated proteins is called chromatin. The chromatin of a chromosome exists in different states of condensation at different times.\n\nTogether, this complex of DNA and protein, called chromatin, fits into the nucleus through an elaborate, multilevel system of packing. Our current view of the successive levels of DNA packing in a chromosome is outlined in Figure 16.22. Study this figure carefully before reading further. Chromatin undergoes striking changes in its degree of packing during the course of the cell cycle (see Figure 12.7). In interphase cells stained for light microscopy, the chromatin usually appears as a diffuse mass within the nucleus, suggesting that the chromatin is highly extended. As a cell prepares for mitosis, its chromatin coils and folds up (condenses), eventually forming a characteristic number of short, thick metaphase chromosomes that are distinguishable from each other with the light microscope. Though interphase chromatin is generally much less condensed than the chromatin of mitotic chromosomes, it shows several of the same levels of higher-order packing. Some of the chromatin comprising a \nchromosome seems to be present as a 10-nm fiber, but much is compacted into a 30-nm fiber, which in some regions is further folded into looped domains. Early on, biologists assumed that interphase chromatin was a tangled mass in the nucleus, like a bowl of spaghetti, but this is far from the case. Although an interphase chromosome lacks an obvious scaffold, its looped domains appear to be attached to the nuclear lamina, on the inside of the nuclear envelope, and perhaps also to fibers of the nuclear matrix. These attachments may help organize regions of chromatin where genes are active. The chromatin of each chromosome occupies a specific restricted area within the interphase nucleus, and the chromatin fibers of different chromosomes do not become entangled (Figure 16.23).\n\nAt metaphase I of meiosis, chromosomes are positioned at the metaphase plate as pairs of homologs, rather than individual chromosomes, as in metaphase of mitosis. Separation of homologs. At anaphase I of meiosis, the duplicated chromosomes of each homologous pair move toward opposite poles, but the sister chromatids of each duplicated chromosome remain attached. In anaphase of mitosis, by contrast, sister chromatids separate. How do sister chromatids stay together through meiosis I but separate from each other in meiosis II and mitosis? Sister chromatids are attached along their lengths by protein complexes called cohesins. In mitosis, this attachment lasts until the end of metaphase, when enzymes cleave the cohesins, freeing the sister chromatids to move to opposite poles of the cell. In meiosis, sister chromatid cohesion is released in two steps, one at the start of anaphase I and one at anaphase II. In metaphase I, homologs are held together by cohesion between sister chromatid arms \nin regions beyond points of crossing over, where stretches of sister chromatids now belong to different chromosomes.\n\nIn species that reproduce sexually, the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis and fertilization is responsible for most of the variation that arises in each generation. Let's examine three mechanisms that contribute to the genetic variation arising from sexual reproduction: independent assortment of chromosomes, crossing over, and random fertilization.\n\nOne aspect of sexual reproduction that generates genetic variation is the random orientation of pairs of homologous chromosomes at metaphase of meiosis I. At metaphase I, the homologous pairs, each consisting of one maternal and one paternal chromosome, are situated at the metaphase plate. (Note that the terms maternal and paternal refer, respectively, to the mother and father of the individual whose cells are undergoing meiosis. ) Each pair may orient with either its maternal or paternal homolog closer to a given pole: its orientation is as random as the flip of a coin.\n\nAt metaphase II, chromosomes that contain one or more recombinant chromatids can be oriented in two alternative, nonequivalent ways with respect to other chromosomes, because their sister chromatids are no longer identical. The different possible arrangements of nonidentical sister chromatids during meiosis II further increase the number of genetic types of daughter cells that can result from meiosis.\n\n", "label": [[50, 162, "Definition"], [289, 377, "Attribute/Property/State"], [379, 390, "Instances/Examples"], [392, 563, "Attribute/Property/State"], [565, 699, "Attribute/Property/State"], [701, 878, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1439, 1508, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1520, 1582, "Definition"], [1584, 1675, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1688, 1811, "Process/Mechanism"], [1967, 2064, "Process/Mechanism"], [2644, 2830, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2866, 2920, "Definition"], [2921, 2946, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [2979, 3191, "Attribute/Property/State"], [3193, 3272, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [3274, 3377, "Attribute/Property/State"], [3378, 3448, "Process/Mechanism"], [4008, 4095, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4097, 4260, "Process/Mechanism"], [5112, 5231, "Attribute/Property/State"], [5378, 5466, "Attribute/Property/State"], [5468, 5518, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [5538, 5743, "Attribute/Property/State"], [184, 287, "Process/Mechanism"], [1349, 1435, "Definition"], [2252, 2410, "Process/Mechanism"], [2415, 2477, "Attribute/Property/State"], [3652, 3895, "Process/Mechanism"], [4942, 5095, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1112, 1195, "Process/Mechanism"], [1197, 1346, "Process/Mechanism"], [2134, 2200, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [2218, 2250, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2486, 2581, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [2583, 2642, "Attribute/Property/State"], [3465, 3562, "Attribute/Property/State"], [3563, 3626, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [4262, 4379, "Process/Mechanism"], [4381, 4582, "Process/Mechanism"], [5745, 5924, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [951, 1110, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4585, 4753, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"]]}
{"id": 774, "data": "Why do small hormone concentrations yield a large effect?\n\nElaborate enzyme cascades amplify the cell's response to a signal. At each catalytic step in the cascade, the number of activated products is much greater than in the preceding step. For example, in the epinephrine-triggered pathway in Figure 11.16, each adenylyl cyclase molecule catalyzes the formation of many cAMP molecules, each molecule of protein kinase A phosphorylates many molecules of the next kinase in the pathway, and so on. The amplification effect stems from the fact that these proteins persist in the active form long enough to process numerous molecules of substrate before they become inactive again. As a result of the signal's amplification, a small number of epinephrine molecules binding to receptors on the surface of a liver cell or muscle cell can lead to the release of hundreds of millions of glucose molecules from glycogen.\n\nFigure 11.16 Cytoplasmic response to a signal: the stimulation of glycogen breakdown by epinephrine. In this signaling system, the hormone epinephrine acts through a G protein-coupled receptor to activate a succession of relay molecules, including cAMP and two protein kinases (see also Figure 11.12). The final protein activated is the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which uses inorganic phosphate to release glucose monomers from glycogen in the form of glucose 1-phosphate molecules. This pathway amplifies the hormonal signal: One receptor protein can activate about 100 molecules of G protein, and each enzyme in the pathway, once activated, can act on many molecules of its substrate, the next molecule in the cascade.\n\nFirst, as mentioned earlier, a signaling pathway with numerous steps between the initial signaling event at the cell surface and the cell's response results in amplification of the signal and thus the response.\n\nFigure 45.12 A simple neuroendocrine pathway. Sensory neurons respond to a stimulus by sending nerve impulses to a neurosecretory cell, triggering secretion of a neurohormone.

In the neuroendocrine pathway for oxytocin signaling, the response increases the stimulus, forming a positive-feedback loop that amplifies signaling in the pathway.\n\nHormone pathways may be regulated by negative feedback, which dampens the stimulus, or positive feedback, which amplifies the stimulus and drives the response to completion.\n\n", "label": [[242, 253, "Instances/Examples"], [1217, 1281, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1899, 1988, "Process/Mechanism"], [2028, 2121, "Process/Mechanism"], [59, 124, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [255, 496, "Process/Mechanism"], [498, 678, "Process/Mechanism"], [928, 1014, "Process/Mechanism"], [1016, 1191, "Process/Mechanism"], [1282, 1400, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1402, 1444, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1446, 1512, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1518, 1638, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1670, 1850, "Process/Mechanism"], [1989, 2027, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2121, 2187, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2189, 2278, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [126, 240, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [680, 912, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2280, 2352, "Process/Mechanism"], [2355, 2527, "Process/Mechanism"]]}

This increase has been fueled by adaptive radiations, periods of evolutionary change in which groups of organisms form many new species whose adaptations allow them to fill different ecological roles, or niches, in their communities. Large-scale adaptive radiations occurred after each of the big five mass extinctions, when survivors became adapted to the many vacant ecological niches. Adaptive radiations have also occurred in groups of organisms that possessed major evolutionary innovations, such as seeds or armored body coverings, or that colonized regions in which they faced little competition from other species.\n\nFigure 25.19 Adaptive radiation of mammals.

Although mammals originated about 180 million years ago, the mammal fossils older than 65.5 million years are mostly small and not morphologically diverse.\n\nEvolutionary history has been punctuated by five mass extinctions that radically altered the history of life. Some of these extinctions may have been caused by changes in continent positions, volcanic activity, or impacts from meteorites or comets. Large increases in the diversity of life have resulted from adaptive radiations that followed mass extinctions.\n\nBy the early Cretaceous, the three major lineages of mammals had emerged: those leading to monotremes (egg-laying mammals), marsupials (mammals with a pouch), and eutherians (placental mammals). After the extinction of large dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and marine reptiles during the late Cretaceous period, mammals underwent an adaptive radiation, giving rise to large predators and herbivores as well as flying and aquatic species.\n\n", "label": [[68, 203, "Process/Mechanism"], [339, 392, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [394, 572, "Definition"], [574, 726, "Process/Mechanism"], [728, 961, "Process/Mechanism"], [1039, 1155, "Process/Mechanism"], [1181, 1227, "Process/Mechanism"], [1229, 1326, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1439, 1576, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1578, 1688, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1691, 1884, "Process/Mechanism"], [239, 306, "Process/Mechanism"], [1373, 1438, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1886, 2118, "Process/Mechanism"]]}
{"id": 778, "data": "Why is it important that male and female gametes are haploid?\n\nFor example, the nuclei of human somatic cells (all body cells except the reproductive cells) each contain 46 chromosomes, made up of two sets of 23, one set inherited from each parent. Reproductive cells, or gametes: sperm and eggs: have half as many chromosomes as somatic cells, or one set of 23 chromosomes in humans.\n\nIn animals and plants, reproductive cells called gametes are the vehicles that transmit genes from one generation to the next. During fertilization, male and female gametes (sperm and eggs) unite, thereby passing on genes of both parents to their offspring.\n\nThe number of chromosomes in a single set is represented by n. Any cell with two chromosome sets is called a diploid cell and has a diploid number of chromosomes, abbreviated 2n. For humans, the diploid number is 46 (2n = 46), the number of chromosomes in our somatic cells. In a cell in which DNA synthesis has occurred, all the chromosomes are duplicated, and therefore each consists of two identical sister chromatids, associated closely at the centromere and along the arms. Figure 13.4 helps clarify the various terms that we use to describe duplicated chromosomes in a diploid cell. Study this figure so that you understand the differences between homologous chromosomes, sister chromatids, nonsister chromatids, and chromosome sets. Unlike somatic cells, gametes contain a single set of chromosomes. Such cells are called haploid cells, and each has a haploid number of chromosomes (n). For humans, the haploid number is 23 (n = 23). The set of 23 consists of the 22 autosomes plus a single \nsex chromosome. An unfertilized egg contains an X chromosome, but a sperm may contain an X or a Y chromosome. Note that each sexually reproducing species has a characteristic diploid number and haploid number.\n\nThe human life cycle begins when a haploid sperm from the father fuses with a haploid egg from the mother. This union of gametes, culminating in fusion of their nuclei, is called fertilization. The resulting fertilized egg, or zygote, is diploid because it contains two haploid sets of chromosomes bearing genes representing the maternal and paternal family lines. As a human develops into a sexually mature adult, mitosis of the zygote and its descendant cells generates all the somatic cells of the body. Both chromosome sets in the zygote and all the genes they carry are passed with precision to the somatic cells. Figure 13.5 The human life cycle. In each generation, the number of chromosome sets doubles at fertilization but is halved during meiosis. For humans, the number of chromosomes in a haploid cell is 23, consisting of one set (n = 23); the number of chromosomes in the diploid zygote and all somatic cells arising from it is 46, consisting of two sets (2n = 46).\n\nImagine what would happen if human gametes were made by mitosis: They would be diploid like the somatic cells. At the next round of fertilization, when two gametes fused, the normal chromosome number of 46 would double to 92, and each subsequent generation would double the number of chromosomes yet again. This does not happen, however, because in sexually reproducing organisms, gamete formation involves a type of cell division called meiosis. This type of cell division reduces the number of sets of chromosomes from two to one in the gametes, counterbalancing the doubling that occurs at fertilization. In animals, meiosis occurs only in germ cells, which are in the ovaries or testes. As a result of meiosis, each human sperm and egg is haploid (n = 23). Fertilization restores the diploid condition by combining two haploid sets of chromosomes, and the human life cycle is repeated, generation after generation (see Figure 13.5).\n\nThe common feature of all three cycles is the alternation of meiosis and fertilization, key events that contribute to genetic variation among offspring. The cycles differ in the timing of these two key events. Although the alternation of meiosis and fertilization is common to all organisms that reproduce sexually, the timing of these two events in the life cycle varies, depending on the species. These variations can be grouped into three main types of life cycles. In the type that occurs in humans and most other animals, gametes are the only haploid cells. Meiosis occurs in germ cells during the production of gametes, which undergo no further cell division prior to fertilization. After fertilization, the diploid zygote divides by mitosis, producing a multicellular organism that is diploid (Figure 13.6a).\n\n13.2 Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles (pp. 250-253) As seen in a karyotype, normal human somatic cells are diploid. They have 46 chromosomes made up of two sets of 23: one set from each parent. In human diploid cells, there are 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, each with a maternal and a paternal homolog. The 23rd pair, the sex chromosomes, determines whether the person is female (XX) or male (XY). At sexual maturity in the human life cycle, ovaries and testes (the gonads) produce haploid gametes by meiosis, each gamete containing a single set of 23 chromosomes (n = 23). During fertilization, an egg and sperm unite, forming a diploid (2n = 46) single-celled zygote, which develops into a multicellular organism by mitosis. Sexual life cycles differ in the timing of meiosis relative to fertilization and in the point(s) of the cycle at which a multicellular organism is produced by mitosis.\n\n", "label": [[63, 74, "Instances/Examples"], [75, 247, "Attribute/Property/State"], [249, 383, "Attribute/Property/State"], [513, 642, "Process/Mechanism"], [708, 806, "Definition"], [1452, 1487, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1754, 1852, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1855, 1960, "Process/Mechanism"], [1962, 2047, "Definition"], [2220, 2360, "Process/Mechanism"], [2362, 2472, "Process/Mechanism"], [2508, 2611, "Process/Mechanism"], [2625, 2833, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2862, 2945, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [3551, 3594, "Attribute/Property/State"], [3597, 3754, "Process/Mechanism"], [3774, 3860, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [3862, 3925, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [4173, 4241, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [4243, 4335, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4337, 4461, "Process/Mechanism"], [4463, 4574, "Process/Mechanism"], [4692, 4730, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4732, 4808, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4809, 4921, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4938, 5016, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [5062, 5128, "Process/Mechanism"], [5130, 5192, "Attribute/Property/State"], [5194, 5345, "Process/Mechanism"], [5347, 5513, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [836, 918, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1017, 1122, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1385, 1450, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [1493, 1537, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1538, 1584, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1586, 1658, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1660, 1704, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1710, 1752, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2049, 2100, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [2108, 2218, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [2947, 3141, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [3182, 3281, "Requirement/Constraint"], [3283, 3442, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [3444, 3525, "Requirement/Constraint"], [3527, 3549, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [3927, 3982, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [3983, 4171, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [4596, 4654, "Process/Mechanism"], [386, 513, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [920, 1001, "Attribute/Property/State"]]}

{"id": 780, "data": "Why is it important for polypeptides to be able to greatly vary in amino acid sequence?\n\nDuring its synthesis, a polypeptide chain begins to coil and fold spontaneously as a consequence of its amino acid sequence (primary structure), forming a protein with a specific shape: a three-dimensional molecule with secondary and tertiary structure (see Figure 5.20). Thus, a gene determines primary structure, and primary structure in turn determines shape.\n\nThe antigen-binding site of a membrane-bound receptor or antibody has a unique shape that provides a lock-and-key fit for a particular epitope. Many noncovalent bonds between an epitope and the binding surface provide a stable and specific interaction. Differences in the amino acid sequences of variable regions provide the variation in binding surfaces that enables this highly specific binding.\n\nA functional protein is not just a polypeptide chain, but one or more polypeptides precisely twisted, folded, and coiled into a molecule of unique shape (Figure 5.18). And it is the amino acid sequence of each polypeptide that determines what three-dimensional structure the protein will have under normal cellular conditions. When a cell synthesizes a polypeptide, the chain generally folds spontaneously, assuming the functional structure for that protein. This folding is driven and reinforced by the formation of a variety of bonds between parts of the chain, which in turn depends on the sequence of amino acids.\n\nThe linear order of bases in a gene specifies the amino acid sequence: the primary structure: of a protein, which in turn specifies that protein's three-dimensional structure and its function in the cell.\n\nRecall that most enzymes are proteins, and proteins are macromolecules with unique three-dimensional configurations. The specificity of an enzyme results from its shape, which is a consequence of its amino acid sequence. Figure 8.14 Induced fit between an enzyme and its substrate. Only a restricted region of the enzyme molecule actually binds to the substrate. This region, called the active site, is typically a pocket or groove on the surface of the enzyme where catalysis occurs (Figure 8.14a). Usually, the active site is formed by only a few of the enzyme's amino acids, with the rest of the protein molecule providing a framework that determines the configuration of the active site. The specificity of an enzyme is attributed to a compatible fit between the shape of its active site and the shape of the substrate.\n\n", "label": [[89, 359, "Process/Mechanism"], [453, 537, "Attribute/Property/State"], [537, 595, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [597, 704, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [852, 1004, "Definition"], [1024, 1177, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1179, 1309, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [1310, 1415, "Process/Mechanism"], [1677, 1714, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1720, 1792, "Definition"], [1794, 1845, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1847, 1897, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1959, 2038, "Process/Mechanism"], [2040, 2160, "Definition"], [2186, 2253, "Attribute/Property/State"], [706, 849, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1416, 1468, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1471, 1540, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1578, 1674, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2369, 2499, "Definition"], [367, 402, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [408, 450, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2259, 2367, "Function/Actions/Roles"]]}
{"id": 781, "data": "Why must signals be transduced?\n\nOnce received at the yeast cell surface, how is the mating signal changed, or transduced, into a form that brings about the cellular response of mating? The received signal is converted to a specific cellular response in a series of steps called a signal transduction pathway. Many such pathways have been extensively studied in both yeast and animal cells. Amazingly, the molecular details of signal transduction in yeast and mammals are strikingly similar, even though the last common ancestor of these two groups of organisms lived over a billion years ago.\n\nThe binding of a specific signaling molecule to a receptor in the plasma membrane triggers the first step in the chain of molecular interactions: the signal transduction pathway: that leads to a particular response within the cell. Like falling dominoes, the signal-activated receptor activates another molecule, which activates yet another molecule, and so on, until the protein that produces the final cellular response is activated.\n\n11.1 External signals are converted to responses within the cell (pp. 206-210) Signal transduction pathways are crucial for many processes, including the mating of yeast cells.\n\nBoth internal signals and external signals control the cell cycle checkpoints via signal transduction pathways.\n\nMany signaling molecules, such as nonsteroid hormones and growth factors, bind to receptors on a cell's surface and never actually enter the cell. Such molecules can control gene expression indirectly by triggering signal transduction pathways that lead to activation of particular transcription activators or repressors (see Figure 11.15).\n\nFigure 39.3 Review of a general model for signal transduction pathways. As discussed in Chapter 11, a hormone or other kind of stimulus interacting with a specific receptor protein can trigger the sequential activation of relay proteins and also the production of second messengers that participate in the pathway. The signal is passed along, ultimately bringing about cellular responses.\n\nSignal transduction pathways amplify the hormonal signal and connect it to a cell's specific responses. In general, hormones control plant growth and development by affecting the division, elongation, and differentiation of cells. Some hormones also mediate shorter-term physiological responses of plants to environmental stimuli. Each hormone has multiple effects, depending on its site of action, its concentration, and the developmental stage of the plant.\n\nResearchers have identified a gas, nitric oxide (NO), as a major inducer of vasodilation and a peptide, endothelin, as the most potent inducer of vasoconstriction. Both NO and endothelin are signaling molecules produced in blood vessels in response to cues from the nervous and endocrine systems. Each kind of molecule binds to a specific receptor, activating a signal transduction pathway that alters smooth muscle contraction and thus changes blood vessel diameter. Vasoconstriction and vasodilation are often coupled to changes in cardiac output that also affect blood pressure. This coordination of regulatory mechanisms maintains adequate blood flow as the body's demands on the circulatory system change.\n\nThe series of changes in cellular proteins that converts the extracellular chemical signal to a specific intracellular response is called signal transduction. As described in Chapter 11, a signal transduction pathway typically involves multiple steps, each involving specific molecular interactions.\n\nIn a simple endocrine pathway, endocrine cells respond directly to an internal or environmental stimulus by secreting a particular hormone (Figure 45.11). The hormone travels in the bloodstream to target cells, where it interacts with its specific receptors. Signal transduction within target cells brings about a physiological response.\n\n", "label": [[186, 308, "Process/Mechanism"], [402, 490, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [773, 825, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [827, 848, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [849, 1029, "Process/Mechanism"], [1323, 1468, "Process/Mechanism"], [1572, 1643, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2055, 2157, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2171, 2216, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2216, 2284, "Process/Mechanism"], [2286, 2384, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2544, 2678, "Definition"], [2679, 2811, "Definition"], [2813, 2982, "Process/Mechanism"], [3098, 3225, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [3228, 3385, "Definition"], [3415, 3526, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3529, 3667, "Process/Mechanism"], [3684, 3786, "Process/Mechanism"], [3788, 3865, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [504, 592, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [595, 739, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1210, 1320, "Process/Mechanism"], [1764, 1901, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1902, 1978, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2984, 3064, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [3069, 3096, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1470, 1566, "Process/Mechanism"], [1980, 2052, "Process/Mechanism"], [1118, 1207, "Requirement/Constraint"], [2386, 2513, "Attribute/Property/State"]]}
{"id": 782, "data": "Why does the nervous system need the endocrine system?\n\nBecause the two major communication systems of the body differ in signal type, transmission, speed, and duration, they are adapted to different functions. The endocrine system is well suited for coordinating gradual changes that affect the entire body, such as growth and development, reproduction, metabolic processes, and digestion. The nervous system is well suited for directing immediate and rapid responses to the environment, especially in controlling fast locomotion and behavior. Although the functions of the endocrine and nervous systems are distinct, the two systems often work in close coordination. Both contribute to maintaining a stable internal environment, our next topic of discussion.\n\nChemical signaling by hormones is the function of the endocrine system, one of the two basic systems of communication and regulation throughout the body. Hormones secreted by endocrine cells regulate reproduction, development, energy metabolism, growth, and behavior. The other major communication and control system is the nervous system, a network of specialized cells: neurons: that transmit signals along dedicated pathways. These signals in turn regulate neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells.

Eukaryotic chromatin making up a chromosome is composed of DNA, histones, and other proteins. The histones bind to each other and to the DNA to form nucleosomes, the most basic units of DNA packing. Histone tails extend outward from each bead-like nucleosome core. Additional coiling and folding leads ultimately to the highly condensed chromatin of the metaphase chromosome. In interphase cells, most chromatin is less compacted (euchromatin), but some remains highly condensed (heterochromatin). Euchromatin, but not heterochromatin, is generally accessible for transcription of genes.\n\nRecall that the DNA of eukaryotic cells is packaged with proteins in an elaborate complex known as chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome (see Figure 16.22). The structural organization of chromatin not only packs a cell's DNA into a compact form that fits inside the nucleus, but also helps regulate gene expression in several ways. The location of a gene's promoter relative to nucleosomes and to the sites where the DNA attaches to the chromosome scaffold or nuclear lamina can affect whether the gene is transcribed. In addition, genes within heterochromatin, which is highly condensed, are usually not expressed.

Augmenting the fuel-mobilizing effects of glucagon from the pancreas, glucocorticoids promote glucose synthesis from noncarbohydrate sources, such as proteins, making more glucose available as fuel. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol (see Figure 45.5), act on skeletal muscle, causing the breakdown of muscle proteins. The resulting amino acids are transported to the liver and kidneys, where they are converted to glucose and released into the blood. The synthesis of glucose from muscle proteins provides circulating fuel when the body requires more glucose than the liver can mobilize from its glycogen stores.

{"id": 787, "data": "Why does it help CAM plants to take carbon dioxide in at night?\n\nA second photosynthetic adaptation to arid conditions has evolved in many succulent (water-storing) plants, numerous cacti, pineapples, and representatives of several other plant families. These plants open their stomata during the night and close them during the day, just the reverse of how other plants behave. Closing stomata during the day helps desert plants conserve water, but it also prevents CO2 from entering the leaves. During the night, when their stomata are open, these plants take up CO2 and incorporate it into a variety of organic acids. This mode of carbon fixation is called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, after the plant family Crassulaceae, the succulents in which the process was first discovered. The mesophyll cells of CAM plants store the organic acids they make during the night in their vacuoles until morning, when the stomata close. During the day, when the light reactions can supply ATP and NADPH for the Calvin cycle, CO2 is released from the organic acids \nmade the night before to become incorporated into sugar in the chloroplasts.\n\nCAM plants open their stomata at night, incorporating CO2 into organic acids, which are stored in mesophyll cells. During the day, the stomata close, and the CO2 is released from the organic acids for use in the Calvin cycle.\n\nIn many types of plants: including a significant number of crop plants: photorespiration drains away as much as 50% of the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle. As heterotrophs that depend on carbon fixation in chloroplasts for our food, we naturally view photorespiration as wasteful. Indeed, if photorespiration could be reduced in certain plant species without otherwise affecting photosynthetic productivity, crop yields and food supplies might increase. In some plant species, alternate modes of carbon fixation have evolved that minimize photorespiration and optimize the Calvin cycle: even in hot, arid climates.

The Calvin cycle incorporates CO2 into organic molecules, which are converted to sugar.\n\nThe cycle begins by incorporating CO2 from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired its cargo of electrons in the light reactions. To convert CO2 to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the NADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions provide the NADPH and ATP that the Calvin \ncycle requires. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.\n\n", "label": [[95, 216, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [218, 294, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [302, 383, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [399, 541, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [543, 629, "Process/Mechanism"], [632, 740, "Process/Mechanism"], [741, 829, "Definition"], [830, 922, "Process/Mechanism"], [924, 963, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [965, 1025, "Process/Mechanism"], [1125, 1172, "Process/Mechanism"], [1180, 1309, "Requirement/Constraint"], [1311, 1398, "Definition"], [1440, 1481, "Requirement/Constraint"], [1027, 1124, "Requirement/Constraint"], [1496, 1648, "Requirement/Constraint"], [1662, 1710, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1710, 1758, "Process/Mechanism"]]}
{"id": 789, "data": "Why does inherited purely self-sacrificing behavior for the good of the species not occur in nature?\n\nHow can such behaviors arise through natural selection? To answer this question, let's look more closely at some examples of unselfish behavior and then consider how such behaviors might arise. In discussing selflessness, we will use the term altruism to describe a behavior that reduces an animal's individual fitness but increases the fitness of other individuals in the population. Consider the Belding's ground squirrel, which lives in some mountainous regions of the western United States and is vulnerable to predators such as coyotes and hawks. A squirrel that sees a predator approach often gives a high-pitched alarm call that alerts unaware individuals to retreat to their burrows. Note that for the squirrel that warns others, the conspicuous alarm behavior increases the risk of being killed because it brings attention to the caller's location. Another example of altruistic behavior occurs in honeybee societies, in which the workers are sterile. The workers themselves never reproduce, \nbut they labor on behalf of a single fertile queen. Furthermore, the workers sting intruders, a behavior that helps defend the hive but results in the death of those workers. Figure 51.27 Naked mole rats, a species of colonial mammal that exhibits altruistic behavior. Pictured here is a queen nursing offspring while surrounded by other members of the colony. Altruism is also observed in naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber), highly social rodents that live in underground chambers and tunnels in southern and northeastern Africa. The naked mole rat, which is almost hairless and nearly blind, lives in colonies of 75 to 250 or more individuals (Figure 51.27). Each colony has only one reproducing female, the queen, who mates with one to three males, called kings. The rest of the colony consists of nonreproductive females and males who forage for underground roots and tubers and care for the queen, the kings, and new offspring. The nonreproductive individuals may sacrifice their own lives in trying to protect \nthe queen or kings from snakes or other predators that invade the colony.\n\nHow can a Belding's ground squirrel, a worker honeybee, or a naked mole rat enhance its fitness by aiding members of the population that may be its closest competitors? How can altruistic behavior be maintained by evolution if it does not enhance the survival and reproductive success of the self-sacrificing individuals? The selection for altruistic behavior is most readily apparent in the case of parents sacrificing for their offspring. When parents sacrifice their own well-being to produce and aid offspring, this actually increases the fitness of the parents because it maximizes their genetic representation in the population. However, individuals sometimes help others who are not their offspring. Biologist William Hamilton proposed that an animal could increase its genetic representation in the next generation by \"altruistically\" helping close relatives other than its own offspring. Like parents and offspring, full siblings have half their genes in common. Therefore, selection might \nalso favor helping siblings or helping one's parents produce more siblings. This idea led to Hamilton's idea of inclusive fitness, the total effect an individual has on proliferating its genes by producing its own offspring and by providing aid that enables other close relatives, who share many of those genes, to produce offspring.\n\nAccording to Hamilton, the three key variables in an act of altruism are the benefit to the recipient, the cost to the altruist, and the coefficient of relatedness. The benefit, B, is the average number of extra offspring that the beneficiary of an altruistic act produces. The cost, C, is how many fewer offspring the altruist produces. The coefficient of relatedness, r, equals the fraction of genes that, on average, are shared. Natural selection favors altruism when the benefit to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness exceeds the cost to the altruist: in other words, when rB ' C. This statement is called Hamilton's rule.\n\n", "label": [[183, 294, "Instances/Examples"], [345, 485, "Definition"], [495, 652, "Attribute/Property/State"], [654, 792, "Process/Mechanism"], [840, 958, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [960, 1027, "Instances/Examples"], [1029, 1061, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1063, 1154, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1168, 1277, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1292, 1371, "Definition"], [1465, 1510, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1640, 1753, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1770, 1824, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1826, 1873, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1875, 1943, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1944, 2010, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2042, 2199, "Process/Mechanism"], [2428, 2521, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2523, 2640, "Instances/Examples"], [2647, 2714, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2716, 2834, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2845, 2906, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2949, 3096, "Process/Mechanism"], [3098, 3171, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [3184, 3275, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [3305, 3533, "Definition"], [3559, 3699, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3701, 3808, "Definition"], [3810, 3872, "Definition"], [3874, 3966, "Definition"], [3967, 4142, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [1510, 1638, "Definition"], [4144, 4184, "Definition"]]}

In this case, the physical connection between genes on the same chromosome is not reflected in the results of genetic crosses. Despite being on the same chromosome and thus being physically connected, the genes are genetically unlinked; alleles of such genes assort independently, as if they were on different chromosomes.

{"id": 791, "data": "Why is increased nitrate in water and the resulting increased bacterial growth bad for the environment?\n\nExperimental deforestation of a watershed dramatically increased the flow of water and minerals leaving the watershed (Figure 55.16b and c). Over three years, water runoff from the newly deforested watershed was 30-40% greater than in a control watershed, apparently because there were no plants to absorb and transpire water from the soil. The concentration of Ca2+ in the creek increased 4-fold, and the concentration of K+ increased by a factor of 15. Most remarkable was the loss of nitrate, whose concentration in the creek increased 60-fold, reaching levels considered unsafe for drinking water (Figure 55.16c). The Hubbard Brook deforestation study showed that the amount of nutrients leaving an intact forest ecosystem is controlled mainly by the plants. Retaining nutrients in ecosystems helps to maintain the productivity of the systems and, in some cases, to avoid problems cause by excess nutrient runoff (see Figure 55.8).\n\nIn addition, as we saw in the case of Hubbard Brook (see Figure 55.16), without plants to take up nitrates from the soil, the nitrates are likely to be leached from the ecosystem. Recent studies indicate that human activities have more than doubled Earth's supply of fixed nitrogen available to primary producers. Industrial fertilizers provide the largest additional nitrogen source. Fossil fuel combustion also releases nitrogen oxides, which enter the atmosphere and dissolve in rainwater; the nitrogen ultimately enters ecosystems as nitrate. Increased cultivation of legumes, with their nitrogen-fixing symbionts, is a third way in which humans increase the amount of fixed nitrogen in the soil. A problem arises when the nutrient level in an ecosystem exceeds the critical load, the amount of added nutrient, usually nitrogen or phosphorus, that can be absorbed by plants without damaging ecosystem integrity. For example, nitrogenous minerals in the soil that exceed the critical load \neventually leach into groundwater or run off into freshwater and marine ecosystems, contaminating water supplies and killing fish. Nitrate concentrations in groundwater are increasing in most agricultural regions, sometimes reaching levels that are unsafe for drinking.\n\n", "label": [[105, 222, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [264, 359, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [372, 444, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [446, 558, "Process/Mechanism"], [560, 705, "Process/Mechanism"], [773, 866, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1055, 1094, "Instances/Examples"], [1251, 1354, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1355, 1425, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1427, 1479, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1481, 1587, "Process/Mechanism"], [1589, 1741, "Process/Mechanism"], [1743, 1825, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [1826, 1956, "Definition"], [1971, 2164, "Process/Mechanism"], [2166, 2303, "Process/Mechanism"], [868, 1021, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1114, 1220, "Statistical Relevance/Correlation"], [1958, 1969, "Instances/Examples"]]}

Darwin rejected this idea, but he, too, thought that variation was introduced into the evolutionary process in part through inheritance of acquired characteristics.

If lactose is added to the bacterium's environment, however, the number of beta-galactosidase molecules in the cell increases a thousandfold within about 15 minutes. The gene for beta-galactosidase is part of the lac operon, which includes two other genes coding for enzymes that function in lactose utilization. The entire transcription unit is under the command of one main operator and promoter. The regulatory gene, lacI, located outside the operon, codes for an allosteric repressor protein that can switch off the lac operon by binding to the operator. So far, this sounds just like regulation of the trp operon, but there is one important difference. Recall that the trp repressor is inactive by itself and requires \ntryptophan as a corepressor in order to bind to the operator. The lac repressor, in contrast, is active by itself, binding to the operator and switching the lac operon off.

{"id": 795, "data": "Why do cells regulate gene expression?\n\nSpecific functions have not been identified for most introns, but at least some contain sequences that regulate gene expression, and many affect gene products. One important consequence of the presence of introns in genes is that a single gene can encode more than one kind of polypeptide. Many genes are known to give rise to two or more different polypeptides, depending on which segments are treated as exons during RNA processing; this is called alternative RNA splicing (see Figure 18.13).\n\nWhy is one particular gene expressed only in the few hundred cells that appear blue in this image and not in the other cells? In this chapter, we first explore how bacteria regulate expression of their genes in response to different environmental conditions. We then examine how eukaryotes regulate gene expression to maintain different cell types.\n\nBacterial cells that can conserve resources and energy have a selective advantage over cells that are unable to do so. Thus, natural selection has favored bacteria that express only the genes whose products are needed by the cell. Consider, for instance, an individual E. coli cell living in the erratic environment of a human colon, dependent for its nutrients on the whimsical eating habits of its host. If the environment is lacking in the amino acid tryptophan, which the bacterium needs to survive, the cell responds by activating a metabolic pathway that makes tryptophan from another compound. Later, if the human host eats a tryptophan-rich meal, the bacterial cell stops producing tryptophan, thus saving itself from squandering its resources to produce a substance that is available from the surrounding solution in prefabricated form. This is just one example of how bacteria tune their metabolism to changing environments.\n\nAll organisms, whether prokaryotes or eukaryotes, must regulate which genes are expressed at any given time. Both unicellular organisms and the cells of multicellular organisms must continually turn genes on and off in response to signals from their external and internal environments. Regulation of gene expression is also essential for cell specialization in multicellular organisms, which are made up of different types of cells, each with a distinct role. To perform its role, each cell type must maintain a specific program of gene expression in which certain genes are expressed and others are not.\n\n", "label": [[115, 167, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [173, 198, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [200, 328, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [475, 514, "Definition"], [542, 619, "Requirement/Constraint"], [886, 1003, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [1011, 1115, "Process/Mechanism"], [1117, 1290, "Instances/Examples"], [1593, 1730, "Process/Mechanism"], [1732, 1819, "Instances/Examples"], [1822, 1929, "Requirement/Constraint"], [1931, 2106, "Requirement/Constraint"], [2108, 2206, "Requirement/Constraint"], [2207, 2253, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [330, 473, "Process/Mechanism"], [700, 793, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [815, 883, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1292, 1485, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [1494, 1586, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [2282, 2425, "Requirement/Constraint"]]}

{"id": 798, "data": "Why is there no effect when there is a chromosomal crossover event between sister chromatids?\n\nCrossing over begins very early in prophase I as homologous chromosomes pair loosely along their lengths. Each gene on one homolog is aligned precisely with the corresponding gene on the other homolog. In a single crossover event, the DNA of two nonsister chromatids: one maternal and one paternal chromatid of a homologous pair: is broken by specific proteins at precisely corresponding points, and the two segments beyond the crossover point are each joined to the other chromatid. Thus, a paternal chromatid is joined to a piece of maternal chromatid beyond the crossover point, and vice versa. In this way, crossing over produces chromosomes with new combinations of maternal and paternal alleles (see Figure 13.11).\n\nDuring meiosis, homologous chromosomes, one inherited from each parent, trade some of their alleles by crossing over. These homologous chromosomes and the alleles they carry are then distributed at random into gametes.\n\nThe important point for now is that crossing over, by combining DNA inherited from two parents into a single chromosome, is an important source of genetic variation in sexual life cycles.\n\nCrossing over involves breakage and rejoining of the DNA of nonsister chromatids in a homologous pair, resulting in recombinant chromatids that will become recombinant chromosomes.\n\nSubsequent experiments demonstrated that this process, now called crossing over, accounts for the recombination of linked genes. In crossing over, which occurs while replicated homologous chromosomes are paired during prophase of meiosis I, a set of proteins orchestrates an exchange of corresponding segments of one maternal and one paternal chromatid (see Figure 13.11).

As Figure 45.5 indicates, hormones vary in their solubility in aqueous and lipid-rich environments. Polypeptides and most amine hormones are water-soluble. Being insoluble in lipids, these hormones cannot pass through the plasma membranes of cells. Instead, they bind to cell-surface receptors that relay information to the nucleus through intracellular pathways.

Receptors for lipid-soluble hormones typically reside in the cytoplasm or nucleus.\n\nFigure 45.6 Receptor location varies with hormone type.

These examples, starch and glycogen, are composed entirely of glucose monomers, represented here by hexagons.

{"id": 804, "data": "Why is a new flu vaccine required each year?\n\nOne mechanism for escaping the body's defenses is for a pathogen to alter how it appears to the immune system. Immunological memory is a record of the foreign epitopes an animal has encountered. If the pathogen that expressed those epitopes no longer does so, it can reinfect or remain in a host without triggering the rapid and robust response that memory cells provide. Such changes in epitope expression, which are called antigenic variation, are regular events for some viruses and parasites. The parasite that causes sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) provides one example. By periodically switching at random among 1,000 different versions of the protein found over its entire surface, this pathogen can persist in the body without facing an effective adaptive immune response (Figure 43.24). Antigenic variation is the major reason the influenza, or \"flu,\" virus remains a major public health problem. As it replicates in one human host after another, the human influenza virus mutates. \nBecause any change that lessens recognition by the immune system provides a selective advantage, the virus steadily accumulates such alterations.

Other hypothalamic cells produce hormones that are transported by portal vessels to the anterior pituitary, where they stimulate or inhibit the release of particular hormones. The two hormones released from the posterior pituitary act directly on nonendocrine tissues. Oxytocin induces uterine contractions and release of milk from mammary glands, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) enhances water reabsorption in the kidneys. Often, anterior pituitary hormones act in a cascade. In the case of thyrotropin, or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), TSH secretion is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TSH in turn induces the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormone, a combination of the iodine-containing hormones T3 and T4.\n\n", "label": [[60, 126, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [140, 239, "Process/Mechanism"], [247, 415, "Process/Mechanism"], [421, 509, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [509, 587, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [593, 662, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [717, 848, "Process/Mechanism"], [850, 914, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"]]}
{"id": 806, "data": "Why is it important for carbon dioxide to be highly concentrated in cells with rubisco?\n\nIn addition, rubisco can bind O2 in place of CO2. As CO2 becomes scarce within the air spaces of the leaf, rubisco adds O2 to the Calvin cycle instead of CO2. The product splits, and a two-carbon compound leaves the chloroplast. Peroxisomes and mitochondria rearrange and split this compound, releasing CO2. The process is called photorespiration because it occurs in the light (photo) and consumes O2 while producing CO2 (respiration). However, unlike normal cellular respiration, photorespiration generates no ATP; in fact, photorespiration consumes ATP. And unlike photosynthesis, photorespiration produces no sugar. In fact, photorespiration decreases photosynthetic output by siphoning organic material from the Calvin cycle and releasing CO2 that would otherwise be fixed.\n\nRecall that in C3 plants, the binding of O2 rather than CO2 by rubisco leads to photorespiration, lowering the efficiency of photosynthesis. C4 plants overcome this problem by concentrating CO2 in the bundle-sheath cells at the cost of ATP. Rising CO2 levels should benefit C3 plants by lowering the amount of photorespiration that occurs.\n\nOn dry, hot days, C3 plants close their stomata, conserving water. Oxygen from the light reactions builds up. In photorespiration, O2 substitutes for CO2 in the active site of rubisco. This process consumes organic fuel and releases CO2 without producing ATP or carbohydrate. Photorespiration may be an evolutionary relic, and it may play a photoprotective role. C4 plants minimize the cost of photorespiration by incorporating CO2 into four-carbon compounds in mesophyll cells.\n\n", "label": [[102, 137, "Attribute/Property/State"], [139, 246, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [248, 316, "Process/Mechanism"], [318, 395, "Process/Mechanism"], [397, 524, "Definition"], [535, 644, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [650, 708, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [718, 866, "Process/Mechanism"], [881, 965, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [966, 1008, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1010, 1108, "Process/Mechanism"], [1110, 1152, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1153, 1207, "Process/Mechanism"], [1210, 1275, "Process/Mechanism"], [1277, 1318, "Process/Mechanism"], [1319, 1393, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1395, 1484, "Process/Mechanism"], [1486, 1531, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1533, 1571, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1573, 1687, "Process/Mechanism"]]}
{"id": 807, "data": "Why are bacteria and archaea able to have huge impacts on the environment despite their small size?\n\nThe second domain, Archaea, consists of a diverse group of prokaryotic organisms that inhabit a wide variety of environments. Some archaea can use hydrogen as an energy source, and others were the chief source of the natural gas deposits that are found throughout Earth's crust.\n\nThe first prokaryotes assigned to domain Archaea live in environments so extreme that few other organisms can survive there. Such organisms are called extremophiles, meaning \"lovers\" of extreme conditions (from the Greek philos, lover), and include extreme halophiles and extreme thermophiles. Extreme halophiles (from the Greek halo, salt) live in highly saline environments, such as the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea (see Figure 27.1). Some species merely tolerate salinity, while others require an environment that is several times saltier than seawater (which has a salinity of 3.5%). For example, the proteins and cell wall of Halobacterium have unusual features that improve function in extremely salty environments but render these organisms incapable of survival if the salinity drops below 9%. Figure 27.16 Extreme thermophiles. Orange and yellow colonies of thermophilic prokaryotes grow in the hot water of a Nevada geyser. Extreme thermophiles (from the Greek thermos, hot) thrive in \nvery hot environments (Figure 27.16). For example, archaea in the genus Sulfolobus live in sulfur-rich volcanic springs as hot as 90 degree C. At temperatures this high, the cells of most organisms die because, for example, their DNA does not remain in a double helix and many of their proteins denature. Sulfolobus and other extreme thermophiles avoid this fate because their DNA and proteins have adaptations that make them stable at high temperatures. One extreme thermophile that lives near deep-sea hot springs called hydrothermal vents is informally known as \"strain 121,\" since it can reproduce even at 121 degree C. Another extreme thermophile, Pyrococcus furiosus, is used in biotechnology as a source of DNA polymerase for the PCR technique (see Chapter 20). Other archaea live in more moderate environments. Consider the methanogens, archaea that release methane as a by-product of their unique ways of obtaining energy. Many methanogens use CO2 to oxidize H2, a process that produces both energy and methane \nwaste. Among the strictest of anaerobes, methanogens are poisoned by O2. Although some methanogens live in extreme environments, such as under kilometers of ice in Greenland, others live in swamps and marshes where other microorganisms have consumed all the O2. The \"marsh gas\" found in such environments is the methane released by these archaea. Other species of methanogens inhabit the anaerobic environment within the guts of cattle, termites, and other herbivores, playing an essential role in the nutrition of these animals. Methanogens also have an important application as decomposers in sewage treatment facilities. Many extreme halophiles and all known methanogens are archaea in the clade Euryarchaeota (from the Greek eurys, broad, a reference to the habitat range of these prokaryotes). The euryarchaeotes also include some extreme thermophiles, though most thermophilic species belong to a second clade, Crenarchaeota (cren means \"spring,\" such as a hydrothermal spring). Recently, genetic prospecting has \nrevealed many species of euryarchaeotes and crenarchaeotes that are not extremophiles. These archaea exist in habitats ranging from farm soils to lake sediments to the surface waters of the open ocean. New findings continue to update the picture of archaeal phylogeny. In 1996, researchers sampling a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park discovered archaea that do not appear to belong to either Euryarchaeota or Crenarchaeota. They placed these archaea in a new clade, Korarchaeota (from the Greek koron, young man). In 2002, researchers exploring hydrothermal vents off the coast of Iceland discovered archaeal cells only 0.4 microm in diameter attached to a much larger crenarchaeote. The genome of the smaller archaean is one of the smallest known of any organism, containing only 500,000 base pairs. Genetic analysis indicates that this prokaryote belongs to a fourth archaeal clade, Nanoarchaeota (from the Greek nanos, dwarf). Within a year after this clade was named, three other DNA sequences from nanoarchaeote \nspecies were isolated: one from Yellowstone's hot springs, one from hot springs in Siberia, and one from a hydrothermal vent in the Pacific. As prospecting continues, it seems likely that the tree in Figure 27.15 will undergo further changes.\n\nBacteria include the vast majority of prokaryotic species of which most people are aware, from the pathogenic species that cause strep throat and tuberculosis to the beneficial species used to make Swiss cheese and yogurt. Every major mode of nutrition and metabolism is represented among bacteria, and even a small taxonomic group of bacteria may contain species exhibiting many different nutritional modes. As we'll see, the diverse nutritional and metabolic capabilities of bacteria: and archaea: are behind the great impact of these tiny organisms on Earth and its life.\n\nIn marine environments, a 2005 study found that an archaean from the clade Crenarchaeota can perform nitrification, a key step in the nitrogen cycle (see Figure 55.14). Crenarchaeotes dominate the oceans by numbers, comprising an estimated 1028 cells. The sheer abundance of these organisms suggests that they may have a large impact on the global nitrogen cycle; scientists are investigating this possibility.\n\n", "label": [[101, 225, "Definition"], [282, 378, "Attribute/Property/State"], [381, 504, "Attribute/Property/State"], [227, 276, "Attribute/Property/State"], [506, 673, "Definition"], [675, 756, "Attribute/Property/State"], [757, 802, "Instances/Examples"], [822, 859, "Attribute/Property/State"], [861, 971, "Requirement/Constraint"], [986, 1051, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1057, 1105, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1110, 1185, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [1222, 1318, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1319, 1402, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1418, 1522, "Instances/Examples"], [1524, 1684, "Process/Mechanism"], [1686, 1834, "Process/Mechanism"], [1836, 1958, "Definition"], [1966, 2003, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2005, 2131, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2209, 2311, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2313, 2351, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2353, 2407, "Process/Mechanism"], [2409, 2473, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2483, 2529, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2530, 2575, "Instances/Examples"], [2577, 2662, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2664, 2747, "Definition"], [2748, 2870, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2871, 2930, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2932, 3024, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [3026, 3114, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3201, 3258, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3267, 3332, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3431, 3507, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3509, 3622, "Attribute/Property/State"], [3774, 3851, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3853, 3907, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [4029, 4111, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4112, 4228, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4262, 4327, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [4691, 4749, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [4785, 4849, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [4857, 4912, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [5001, 5098, "Attribute/Property/State"], [5114, 5264, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [5315, 5381, "Attribute/Property/State"], [5383, 5415, "Definition"], [5519, 5629, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"]]}
{"id": 808, "data": "Why do some lymphocytes remain even after an antigen has been eliminated?\n\nTo begin with, an antigen is presented to a steady stream of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes (see Figure 43.7) until a match is made. A successful match then triggers changes in cell number and activity for the lymphocyte to which an antigen has bound. The binding of an antigen receptor to an epitope initiates events that activate the lymphocyte. Once activated, a B cell or T cell undergoes multiple cell divisions. For each activated cell, the result of this proliferation is a clone, a population of cells that are identical to the original cell. Some cells from this clone become effector cells, short-lived cells that take effect immediately against the antigen and any pathogens producing that antigen. The effector forms of B cells are plasma cells, which secrete antibodies. The effector forms of T cells are helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells, whose roles we'll explore in Concept 43.3. The remaining cells in the clone become memory cells, long-lived cells that can give rise to effector \ncells if the same antigen is encountered later in the animal's life.\n\nImmunological memory is responsible for the long-term protection that a prior infection or vaccination provides against many diseases, such as chickenpox. This type of protection was noted almost 2,400 years ago by the Greek historian Thucydides. He observed that individuals who had recovered from the plague could safely care for those who were sick or dying, \"for the same man was never attacked twice: never at least fatally. \" Figure 43.15 The specificity of immunological memory. Long-lived memory cells generated in the primary response to antigen A give rise to a heightened secondary response to the same antigen, but do not affect the primary response to a different antigen (B). Prior exposure to an antigen alters the speed, strength, and duration of the immune response. The production of effector cells from a clone of lymphocytes during the first exposure to an antigen is the basis for the primary immune response. The primary response peaks about 10-17 days after the initial \nexposure. During this time, selected B cells and T cells give rise to their effector forms. If an individual is exposed again to the same antigen, the response is faster (typically peaking only 2-7 days after exposure), of greater magnitude, and more prolonged. This is the secondary immune response, a hallmark of adaptive, or acquired, immunity.\n\nThe secondary immune response relies on the reservoir of T and B memory cells generated following initial exposure to an antigen. Because these cells are long-lived, they provide the basis for immunological memory, which can span many decades. (Effector cells have much shorter life spans, which is why the immune response diminishes after an infection is overcome. ) If an antigen is encountered again, memory cells specific for that antigen enable the rapid formation of clones of thousands of effector cells also specific for that antigen, thus generating a greatly enhanced immune defense.\n\nAs noted earlier, both the humoral and cell-mediated responses can include primary and secondary immune responses. Memory cells of each type: helper T cell, B cell, and cytotoxic T cell: enable the secondary response. For example, when body fluids are reinfected by a pathogen encountered previously, memory B cells and memory helper T cells initiate a secondary humoral response.\n\nToday, many sources of antigen are used to make vaccines, including inactivated bacterial toxins, killed pathogens, parts of pathogens, weakened pathogens that generally do not cause illness, and even genes encoding microbial proteins. Because all of these agents induce a primary immune response and immunological memory, an encounter with the pathogen from which the vaccine was derived triggers a rapid and strong secondary immune response (see Figure 43.15).\n\n43.2 In adaptive immunity, receptors provide pathogen-specific recognition (pp. 935-940) Adaptive immunity relies on lymphocytes that arise from stem cells in the bone marrow and complete their maturation in the bone marrow (B cells) or in the thymus (T cells). Lymphocytes have cell-surface antigen receptors for foreign molecules. All receptor proteins on a single B or T cell are the same, but there are millions of B and T cells in the body that differ in the foreign molecules that their receptors recognize. Upon infection, B and T cells specific for the pathogen are activated. Some T cells help other lymphocytes; others kill infected host cells. B cells called plasma cells produce soluble receptor proteins called antibodies, which bind to foreign molecules and cells. The activated lymphocytes called memory cells defend against future infections by the same pathogen.\n\n", "label": [[90, 206, "Process/Mechanism"], [208, 325, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [327, 421, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [423, 491, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [493, 561, "Process/Mechanism"], [563, 624, "Definition"], [626, 783, "Process/Mechanism"], [785, 857, "Attribute/Property/State"], [859, 929, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [974, 1044, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1050, 1144, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [1147, 1280, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1411, 1507, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1514, 1575, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1633, 1768, "Process/Mechanism"], [1770, 1831, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1837, 1929, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1931, 2076, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2078, 2149, "Process/Mechanism"], [2169, 2231, "Process/Mechanism"], [2233, 2401, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [2403, 2487, "Definition"], [2490, 2567, "Requirement/Constraint"], [2568, 2618, "Process/Mechanism"], [2628, 2654, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2656, 2703, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2858, 3031, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [3037, 3082, "Process/Mechanism"], [3102, 3198, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [3200, 3301, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [3303, 3314, "Instances/Examples"], [3316, 3464, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [3474, 3523, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [3524, 3621, "Instances/Examples"], [3621, 3657, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [3711, 3788, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [3790, 3909, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [3958, 4006, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [4020, 4059, "Requirement/Constraint"], [4065, 4191, "Process/Mechanism"], [4193, 4262, "Attribute/Property/State"], [4264, 4322, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [4323, 4443, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [4445, 4514, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [4515, 4584, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [4586, 4708, "Process/Mechanism"], [4710, 4809, "Function/Actions/Roles"]]}

{"id": 812, "data": "why do enzymes have specific locations within a cell?\n\nFigure 8.16 Environmental factors affecting enzyme activity. Each enzyme has an optimal (a) temperature and (b) pH that favor the most active shape of the protein molecule. Temperature and pH are environmental factors important in the activity of an enzyme. Up to a point, the rate of an enzymatic reaction increases with increasing temperature, partly because substrates collide with active sites more frequently when the molecules move rapidly. Above that temperature, however, the speed of the enzymatic reaction drops sharply. The thermal agitation of the enzyme molecule disrupts the hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and other weak interactions that stabilize the active shape of the enzyme, and the protein molecule eventually denatures. Each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which its reaction rate is greatest. Without denaturing the enzyme, this temperature allows the greatest number of molecular collisions and the fastest conversion of the reactants to product molecules. Most human \nenzymes have optimal temperatures of about 35-40 degree C (close to human body temperature). The thermophilic bacteria that live in hot springs contain enzymes with optimal temperatures of 70 degree C or higher (Figure 8.16a on the next page). Just as each enzyme has an optimal temperature, it also has a pH at which it is most active. The optimal pH values for most enzymes fall in the range of pH 6-8, but there are exceptions. For example, pepsin, a digestive enzyme in the human stomach, works best at pH 2. Such an acidic environment denatures most enzymes, but pepsin is adapted to maintain its functional three-dimensional structure in the acidic environment of the stomach.

{"id": 813, "data": "Why do polar molecules need transport proteins to pass through membranes?\n\nNonpolar molecules, such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, are hydrophobic and can therefore dissolve in the lipid bilayer of the membrane and cross it easily, without the aid of membrane proteins. However, the hydrophobic interior of the membrane impedes the direct passage of ions and polar molecules, which are hydrophilic, through the membrane. Polar molecules such as glucose and other sugars pass only slowly through a lipid bilayer, and even water, an extremely small polar molecule, does not cross very rapidly. A charged atom or molecule and its surrounding shell of water (see Figure 3.7) find the hydrophobic interior of the membrane even more difficult to penetrate. Furthermore, the lipid bilayer is only one aspect of the gatekeeper system responsible for the selective permeability of a cell. Proteins built into the membrane play key roles in regulating transport.\n\nCell membranes are permeable to specific ions and a variety of polar molecules. These hydrophilic substances can avoid contact with the lipid bilayer by passing through transport proteins that span the membrane. Some transport proteins, called channel proteins, function by having a hydrophilic channel that certain molecules or atomic ions use as a tunnel through the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, left). For example, the passage of water molecules through the membrane in certain cells is greatly facilitated by channel proteins known as aquaporins. Each aquaporin allows entry of up to 3 billion (3 * 109) water molecules per second, passing single file through its central channel, which fits ten at a time. Without aquaporins, only a tiny fraction of these water molecules would pass through the same area of the cell membrane in a second, so the channel protein brings about a tremendous increase in rate. Other transport proteins, called carrier proteins, hold onto their passengers and change \nshape in a way that shuttles them across the membrane (see Figure 7.10a, right). A transport protein is specific for the substance it translocates (moves), allowing only a certain substance (or a small group of related substances) to cross the membrane.\n\n", "label": [[75, 160, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [165, 244, "Attribute/Property/State"], [293, 388, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [435, 524, "Attribute/Property/State"], [530, 604, "Attribute/Property/State"], [606, 763, "Attribute/Property/State"], [778, 892, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [894, 965, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [968, 1046, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1048, 1178, "Process/Mechanism"], [1180, 1345, "Process/Mechanism"], [1372, 1383, "Instances/Examples"], [1384, 1516, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1518, 1676, "Process/Mechanism"], [1678, 1809, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [1811, 1876, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1878, 2021, "Definition"], [2049, 2220, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"]]}
{"id": 814, "data": "Why is water lost through the open stomata of plants?\n\nEVOLUTION Ever since plants first moved onto land about 475 million years ago, they have been adapting to the problems of terrestrial life, particularly the problem of dehydration. In Chapters 29 and 36, we will consider anatomical adaptations that help plants conserve water, while in this chapter we are concerned with metabolic adaptations. The solutions often involve trade-offs. An important example is the compromise between photosynthesis and the prevention of excessive water loss from the plant. The CO2 required for photosynthesis enters a leaf via stomata, the pores on the leaf surface (see Figure 10.4). However, stomata are also the main avenues of transpiration, the evaporative loss of water from leaves. On a hot, dry day, most plants close their stomata, a response that conserves water. This response also reduces photosynthetic yield by limiting access to CO2. With stomata even partially closed, CO2 concentrations begin to decrease in the air spaces within the leaf, and the \nconcentration of O2 released from the light reactions begins to increase.\n\nMoss and hornwort sporophytes are often larger and more complex than those of liverworts. Both moss and hornwort sporophytes also have specialized pores called stomata (singular, stoma), which are also found in all vascular plants. These pores support photosynthesis by allowing the exchange of CO2 and O2 between the outside air and the sporophyte interior (see Figure 10.3). Stomata are also the main avenues by which water evaporates from the sporophyte. In hot, dry conditions, the stomata close, minimizing water loss.\n\nFigure 35.18 Leaf anatomy. Figure 35.18 provides an overview of leaf structure. The epidermis is interrupted by pores called stomata (singular, stoma), which allow exchange of CO2 and O2 between the surrounding air and the photosynthetic cells inside the leaf. In addition to regulating CO2 uptake for photosynthesis, stomata are major avenues for the evaporative loss of water. The term stoma can refer to the stomatal pore or to the entire stomatal complex consisting of a pore flanked by two guard cells, which regulate the opening and closing of the pore.\n\nTranspirational Pull Stomata on a leaf's surface lead to a maze of internal air spaces that expose the mesophyll cells to the CO2 they need for photosynthesis. The air in these spaces is saturated with water vapor because it is in contact with the moist walls of the cells. On most days, the air outside the leaf is drier; that is, it has lower water potential than the air inside the leaf. Therefore, water vapor in the air spaces of a leaf diffuses down its water potential gradient and exits the leaf via the stomata. It is this loss of water vapor by diffusion and evaporation that we call transpiration.\n\nThe role of negative pressure potential in transpiration is consistent with the water potential equation because negative pressure potential (tension) lowers water potential (see Figure 36.8). Because water moves from areas of higher water potential to areas of lower water potential, the more negative pressure potential at the air-water interface causes water in xylem cells to be \"pulled\" into mesophyll cells, which lose water to the air spaces, the water diffusing out through stomata. In this way, the negative water potential of leaves provides the \"pull\" in transpirational pull. The transpirational pull on xylem sap is transmitted all the way from the leaves to the root tips and even into the soil solution (Figure 36.13).\n\n", "label": [[64, 234, "Process/Mechanism"], [276, 330, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [439, 558, "Instances/Examples"], [623, 652, "Definition"], [776, 859, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [861, 934, "Process/Mechanism"], [935, 1042, "Process/Mechanism"], [1048, 1125, "Process/Mechanism"], [1128, 1216, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [1218, 1295, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1315, 1358, "Attribute/Property/State"], [1360, 1394, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1394, 1486, "Process/Mechanism"], [1505, 1584, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1586, 1650, "Process/Mechanism"], [1732, 1803, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1805, 1912, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [1914, 1969, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1971, 2030, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2161, 2211, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2214, 2372, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [2374, 2486, "Process/Mechanism"], [2502, 2603, "Attribute/Property/State"], [2615, 2733, "Process/Mechanism"], [2734, 2821, "Definition"], [3025, 3108, "Process/Mechanism"], [3108, 3236, "Causal Interaction/Impact/Trigger"], [3238, 3313, "Process/Mechanism"], [3328, 3410, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [3412, 3541, "Process/Mechanism"], [559, 621, "Process/Mechanism"], [672, 731, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [733, 774, "Definition"], [2032, 2159, "Definition"]]}
{"id": 815, "data": "Why are the reaction environments for chlorophyll a different between the two photosystems?\n\nThe thylakoid membrane is populated by two types of photosystems that cooperate in the light reactions of photosynthesis. They are called photosystem II (PS II) and photosystem I (PS I). (They were named in order of their discovery, but photosystem II functions first in the light reactions. ) Each has a characteristic reaction-center complex: a particular kind of primary electron acceptor next to a special pair of chlorophyll a molecules associated with specific proteins. The reaction-center chlorophyll a of photosystem II is known as P680 because this pigment is best at absorbing light having a wavelength of 680 nm (in the red part of the spectrum). The chlorophyll a at the reaction-center complex of photosystem I is called P700 because it most effectively absorbs light of wavelength 700 nm (in the far-red part of the spectrum). These two pigments, P680 and P700, are nearly identical chlorophyll a molecules. However, their association with different proteins in the thylakoid membrane \naffects the electron distribution in the two pigments and accounts for the slight differences in their light-absorbing properties. Now let's see how the two photosystems work together in using light energy to generate ATP and NADPH, the two main products of the light reactions.\n\nA photosystem is composed of a reaction-center complex surrounded by light-harvesting complexes that funnel the energy of photons to the reaction-center complex. When a special pair of reaction-center chlorophyll a molecules absorbs energy, one of its electrons is boosted to a higher energy level and transferred to the primary electron acceptor. Photosystem II contains P680 chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction-center complex; photosystem I contains P700 molecules.\n\n", "label": [[93, 213, "Attribute/Property/State"], [215, 278, "Definition"], [387, 436, "Attribute/Property/State"], [438, 568, "Definition"], [570, 638, "Definition"], [647, 716, "Attribute/Property/State"], [752, 832, "Definition"], [840, 895, "Attribute/Property/State"], [935, 1014, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [1025, 1223, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [1243, 1325, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1374, 1469, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1535, 1720, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [1722, 1762, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1763, 1805, "Definition"], [1807, 1844, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1469, 1534, "Function/Actions/Roles"]]}
{"id": 816, "data": "Why does the nadph need to be made by the light reactions?\n\n10.2 The light reactions convert solar energy to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH 10.3 The Calvin cycle uses the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH to reduce CO2 to sugar\n\nFigure 10.6 An overview of photosynthesis: cooperation of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. In the chloroplast, the thylakoid membranes are the sites of the light reactions, whereas the Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma. The light reactions use solar energy to make ATP and NADPH, which supply chemical energy and reducing power, respectively, to the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle incorporates CO2 into organic molecules, which are converted to sugar.\n\nThe light reactions are the steps of photosynthesis that convert solar energy to chemical energy. Water is split, providing a source of electrons and protons (hydrogen ions, H+) and giving off O2 as a by-product. Light absorbed by chlorophyll drives a transfer of the electrons and hydrogen ions from water to an acceptor called NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), where they are temporarily stored. The electron acceptor NADP+ is first cousin to NAD+, which functions as an electron carrier in cellular respiration; the two molecules differ only by the presence of an extra phosphate group in the NADP+ molecule. The light reactions use solar power to reduce NADP+ to NADPH by adding a pair of electrons along with an H+. The light reactions also generate ATP, using chemiosmosis to power the addition of a phosphate group to ADP, a process called photophosphorylation. Thus, light energy is initially converted to chemical energy in the form of two compounds: NADPH, a source of \nelectrons as \"reducing power\" that can be passed along to an electron acceptor, reducing it, and ATP, the versatile energy currency of cells. Notice that the light reactions produce no sugar; that happens in the second stage of photosynthesis, the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, who, along with his colleagues, began to elucidate its steps in the late 1940s. The cycle begins by incorporating CO2 from the air into organic molecules already present in the chloroplast. This initial incorporation of carbon into organic compounds is known as carbon fixation. The Calvin cycle then reduces the fixed carbon to carbohydrate by the addition of electrons. The reducing power is provided by NADPH, which acquired its cargo of electrons in the light reactions. To convert CO2 to carbohydrate, the Calvin cycle also requires chemical energy in the form of ATP, which is also generated by the light reactions. Thus, it is the Calvin cycle that makes sugar, but it can do so only with the help of the \nNADPH and ATP produced by the light reactions. The metabolic steps of the Calvin cycle are sometimes referred to as the dark reactions, or light-independent reactions, because none of the steps requires light directly. Nevertheless, the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight, for only then can the light reactions provide the NADPH and ATP that the Calvin cycle requires. In essence, the chloroplast uses light energy to make sugar by coordinating the two stages of photosynthesis.\n\nThe Calvin cycle requires ATP and NADPH, products of the light reactions.\n\nAs complicated as the scheme shown in Figure 10.14 is, do not lose track of its functions. The light reactions use solar power to generate ATP and NADPH, which provide chemical energy and reducing power, respectively, to the carbohydrate-synthesizing reactions of the Calvin cycle. The energy changes of electrons during their linear flow through the light reactions are shown in a mechanical analogy in Figure 10.15.\n\nThese light-driven reactions store chemical energy in NADPH and ATP, which shuttle the energy to the carbohydrate-producing Calvin cycle.\n\nThe Calvin cycle is similar to the citric acid cycle in that a starting material is regenerated after molecules enter and leave the cycle. However, while the citric acid cycle is catabolic, oxidizing acetyl CoA and using the energy to synthesize ATP, the Calvin cycle is anabolic, building carbohydrates from smaller molecules and consuming energy. Carbon enters the Calvin cycle in the form of CO2 and leaves in the form of sugar. The cycle spends ATP as an energy source and consumes NADPH as reducing power for adding high-energy electrons to make the sugar. Figure 10.19 The Calvin cycle. This diagram tracks carbon atoms (gray balls) through the cycle. The three phases of the cycle correspond to the phases discussed in the text. For every three molecules of CO2 that enter the cycle, the net output is one molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), a three-carbon sugar. The light reactions sustain the Calvin cycle by regenerating ATP and NADPH.\n\nFor the net synthesis of one G3P molecule, the Calvin cycle consumes a total of nine molecules of ATP and six molecules of NADPH. The light reactions regenerate the ATP and NADPH. The G3P spun off from the Calvin cycle becomes the starting material for metabolic pathways that synthesize other organic compounds, including glucose and other carbohydrates. Neither the light reactions nor the Calvin cycle alone can make sugar from CO2. Photosynthesis is an emergent property of the intact chloroplast, which integrates the two stages of photosynthesis.\n\nIn this chapter, we have followed photosynthesis from photons to food. The light reactions capture solar energy and use it to make ATP and transfer electrons from water to NADP+, forming NADPH. The Calvin cycle uses the ATP and NADPH to produce sugar from carbon dioxide. The energy that enters the chloroplasts as sunlight becomes stored as chemical energy in organic compounds.\n\nPhotosynthesis is summarized as 6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light energy &rarr; C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O. Chloroplasts split water into hydrogen and oxygen, incorporating the electrons of hydrogen into sugar molecules. Photosynthesis is a redox process: H2O is oxidized, and CO2 is reduced. The light reactions in the thylakoid membranes split water, releasing O2, producing ATP, and forming NADPH. The Calvin cycle in the stroma forms sugar from CO2, using ATP for energy and NADPH for reducing power.\n\n10.3 The Calvin cycle uses the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH to reduce CO2 to sugar (pp. 198-199) The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma, using electrons from NADPH and energy from ATP. One molecule of G3P exits the cycle per three CO2 molecules fixed and is converted to glucose and other organic molecules.\n\n10.1 Photosynthesis converts light energy to the chemical energy of food 10.2 The light reactions convert solar energy to the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH 10.3 The Calvin cycle uses the chemical energy of ATP and NADPH to reduce CO2 to sugar\n\n", "label": [[65, 145, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [151, 232, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [334, 415, "Definition"], [416, 461, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [463, 521, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [523, 605, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [607, 693, "Process/Mechanism"], [696, 792, "Definition"], [794, 907, "Process/Mechanism"], [908, 1111, "Process/Mechanism"], [1113, 1164, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [1166, 1228, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1230, 1325, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [1327, 1434, "Process/Mechanism"], [1436, 1582, "Process/Mechanism"], [1590, 1673, "Process/Mechanism"], [1675, 1773, "Definition"], [1792, 1835, "Definition"], [1849, 1885, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [1887, 1955, "Process/Mechanism"], [2082, 2190, "Process/Mechanism"], [2192, 2279, "Definition"], [2280, 2372, "Process/Mechanism"], [2374, 2413, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2414, 2475, "Process/Mechanism"], [2476, 2575, "Requirement/Constraint"], [2576, 2622, "Process/Mechanism"], [2630, 2669, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [2674, 2760, "Requirement/Constraint"], [2762, 2849, "Definition"], [2891, 2932, "Requirement/Constraint"], [2948, 3002, "Conditional/If-then/Relationship"], [3112, 3208, "Process/Mechanism"], [3211, 3283, "Requirement/Constraint"], [3377, 3438, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [3440, 3566, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [3705, 3841, "Process/Mechanism"], [3844, 3981, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [3991, 4191, "Analogy/Similarity/Comparison"], [4193, 4274, "Process/Mechanism"], [4276, 4405, "Process/Mechanism"], [4580, 4723, "Process/Mechanism"], [4725, 4799, "Process/Mechanism"], [4802, 4930, "Process/Mechanism"], [4932, 4980, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [4982, 5156, "Process/Mechanism"], [5158, 5236, "Attribute/Property/State"], [5238, 5302, "Attribute/Property/State"], [5304, 5353, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [5427, 5548, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [5550, 5626, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [5628, 5734, "Process/Mechanism"], [5830, 5941, "Process/Mechanism"], [5942, 5976, "Taxonomic/Meronymic"], [5978, 6013, "Process/Mechanism"], [6015, 6121, "Process/Mechanism"], [6123, 6225, "Process/Mechanism"], [6233, 6315, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [6329, 6414, "Process/Mechanism"], [6545, 6613, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [6618, 6699, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [6704, 6785, "Function/Actions/Roles"], [3008, 3098, "Requirement/Constraint"]]}
